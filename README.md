# Sweetilious

Introduction:
We designed a website named Sweetilicious, an e-commerce platform dedicated to handcrafted confectionery and savoury delights.

Objective: 
Developed to connect talented chefs with a wider audience, our project aims to satisfy the growing demand for homemade goods. 
With robust security features including SSL, MFA, and protection against SQL injection, we ensure a safe and seamless shopping experience. 
We have developed this website to bridge the e-commerce gap and empowering artisans to showcase their culinary talents.
